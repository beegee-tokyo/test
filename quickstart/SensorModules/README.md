## Introduction

WisBlock is an amazing product built by RAK company for IoT industry. It can build circuits like building blocks quickly to realize your idea, and through high-speed connectors and fasteners interconnection, it can directly compose the reliable industrial products.

WisBlock consists of WisBlock Base, WisBlock Core, WisBlock Sensor, and WisBlock IO.

RAK5005-O is the WisBlock Base board which can be connected with WisBlock Core and WisBlock IO through the connector of the board, and provides direct data bus interconnection. WisBlock Base module also integrates the power supply circuit to realize low power battery power supply. In order to facilitate users, WisBlock Base has reserved USB ports, indicator lights, keys and extended IO interfaces.

WisBlock is not only a functional test capable product in product development verification stage, but also industrial products oriented to mass production. It uses a high-speed connector to ensure the integrity of the signal. At the same time, it is equipped with fastening screw, which can be used in vibration environment. And WisBlock can be used reliably in various civil and industrial scenarios through rigorous reliability tests.

WisBlock uses a compact stacked hardware design, which integrates various computing, connecting and sensor circuits in the size of 60*30mm. The compact size makes it easy for users to build in various customized housings to achieve complete products. RAK also have a series of housings for WisBlock modules, which can meet the requirements of various protection levels.
