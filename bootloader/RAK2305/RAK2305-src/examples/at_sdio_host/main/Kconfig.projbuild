menu "Example Configuration"

config SDIO_EXAMPLE_4BIT
    bool "Host tries using 4-bit mode to communicate with slave"
    default n
    help
        If this is set, the host tries using 4-bit mode to communicate with
        slave. If failed, the communication falls back to 1-bit mode.
        
        If this is not set, the host uses 1-bit mode. However, DAT1 is still
        mandatory for interrupts.

        Note that 4-bit mode is not compatible (by default) if the slave is
        using 3.3V flash which requires a pull-down on the MTDI pin (Stripping pin).

config SDIO_EXAMPLE_HIGHSPEED
    bool "Host tries using HS mode to communicate with slave"
    default y
    help
        If this is set, the host tries using high-speed (40M) mode to communicate
        with slave. If the slave doesn't support high-speed mode, the
        communication falls back to default-speed (20M) mode. If this is not set,
        the host uses default speed mode.

        If the example does not work, please try disabling the high-speed mode.
